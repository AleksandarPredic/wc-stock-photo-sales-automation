# WooCommerce stock photography sales automation

## Short description
This set of custom child theme and plugin represents a solution 
where you just upload a couple of photos to the WordPress / WooCommerce website and 
then you can immediately start selling them via the website. 

The photos are automatically converted to digital products within the WooCommerce store and are ready to 
be purchased. 

## More details
In that process we do the following: 
* Resize the image for the preview in various sizes 
* Optimize the image for the website
* Add the watermark
* Read the image metadata where all the data was stored (name, size, categories, tags, models names....)
* Create the digital products in the WooCommerce 
* Store the original file for the download after the purchase 

In short terms, if you are a professional photographer and you have a collection of stock photos ready for the big 
sites where you sell them, you can use the same photos for the personal stock photos website and 
have a single click setup for uploading multiple photos at once.
